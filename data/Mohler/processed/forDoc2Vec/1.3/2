1.3 This type of programming is more flexible, making it easier to add and modify the program.  It is also a type of a fail safe program, you check each individual module.  This eliminates redundant code and makes the program easier to read for other programmers.  When debugging the program it is easier to track down the source of a problem within a module rather than a 2 million line program.
