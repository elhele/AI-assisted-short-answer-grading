8.7 Depends on the type of stack, on a true stack you will haft to pop all of the elements of the stack until you find the element you want, and then after that you will need to push all the elements that where removed back in to the stack in the order that they where removed. With a Java style stack, where there is a peek function, it will return the element you wanted instead of requiring you to perform all the excessive actions that are required from a true stack.
