7.5 In the case of a non circular link list, if you are at the last node of the list and u want to move to first u need to go to one, step back till u reach to first. But in circular link list from last to first you need to make only one move. In a single link list u can move only in one direction but in double link list u can move in any direction back or forward or forward.
