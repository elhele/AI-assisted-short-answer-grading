12.10 If the binary search tree is constructed efficiently, best case scenario is O(log n) time.  Where n is the number of items in the tree. If the binary search tree is constructed poorly, with for instance the root of the tree being 1, and progressing downwards and to the right its children are each more than the last: you have a one-way linear linked list.  That worse case scenario would be a full traversal at O(n) time. Where n is the number of items in the tree.
