11.5 A recursive function is a function that breaks down a large problem into two or more smaller problems and calls itself to solve those smaller problems until a base case or terminating point is reached.  At the base case, a definite answer is called and the function no longer recurses, but unwinds itself back through function calls to determine the answer to the original large problem.
