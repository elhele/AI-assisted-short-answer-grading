3.7 Both are based on a control statement.        - Iteration-repetition structure.        - Recursion-selection structure..      Both involve repetition.        -Iteration-explicitly uses repetition structure.        -Recursion-repeated function calls..      Both involve a termination test.        -Iteration-loop-termination test.        -Recursion-base case ..      Both gradually approach termination.        -Iteration-modifies counter until loop-termination test fails.        -Recursion-produces progressively simpler versions of problem..      Both can occur indefinitely.        -Iteration-if loop-continuation condition never fails.        -Recursion-if recursion step does not simplify the problem
