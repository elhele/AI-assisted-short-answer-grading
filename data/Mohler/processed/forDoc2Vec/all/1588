9.4 theoretically you could do it two ways one of which uses more processing power and memory no larger than the queue is ever at when full and the other which uses almost infinite memory. The more practical method would be two place the items in an array and remove the item in position one of the array after which you can shift the array and add another element if required. The other option which can use infinite memory when used for long term queues such as job scheduling that goes nonstop for extended periods. that is to implement an array and add the items read item one raise your counter value to two ecetera and continue adding more elements to the array. the downside to this method is after you use element one it is still in memory. or im crazy who knows
