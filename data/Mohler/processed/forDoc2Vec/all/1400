8.4 This is the implementation of the stack using single linked list..  The operations performed on a stack are..  1)push(): This is the function which is for insertion(pushing)of an element into stack.              .      It is similar to the insertion of an element at the end of a single linked list.     .            see  the function insert_end() in the program for operations of single linked list..  2)pop(): This is the function which is for deletion(popping up) of an element from the stack..           It is similar to the deletion of an element at the end of a single linked list..     see  the function delete_end() in the program for operations of single linked list..  3)stack_display():This is the function which is for displaying the elements of a stack
