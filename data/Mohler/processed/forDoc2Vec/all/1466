8.6 i have an hard time explaining this so i'll show how infix is evaluated instead..Start with an infix expression, like, .(((5+2)*5)+(400/(2+3))), and  push items until you get a ")" and once that happens, perform the operations until you reach an "("... with that complete, you will now have .((7*5)+(400/(2+3))) as now the expression that will be evaluated... perform last step again....(35+(400/(2+3))) is now the stack.... repeat agian....(35+(400/5)) is now the stack after that.... repeat....(35+80) is now the stack, repeat again....115 is now the stack, and is returned.
