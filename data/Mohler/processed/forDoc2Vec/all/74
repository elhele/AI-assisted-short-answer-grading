1.3 Coding and Debugging programs are usually easier, as either the compiler will specify the object that is working incorrectly, or the function an object was assigned to will be easier to identify.  The code itself also looks more organized and is easier to read and will help to avoid redundant coding.  Post-programming maintenance is also easier...Also, modules can be reused several times in other programs without too much hassle.   Abstraction is the art of breaking down one big problem into smaller, simpler problems and solving them.  Many of the smaller problems are shared between unique complex problems, and creating modules to these solve these smaller repeated problems can save time when you encounter them again.
