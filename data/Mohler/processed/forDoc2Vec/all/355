2.6 The FUNCTION PROTOTYPE is where the programmer declares that he/she is using a function other than main( ). This is like declaring a variable, the programmer knows that he/she will be using in the future, but has yet to say where they are going to use it, or how. This is answers the question who, it gives the function a name and character. The function prototype, by common practice is placed at the beginning of the program after the #includes and before main( )..The FUNCTION DEFINITION is the guts of the function. This is where the programmer decides what the function is going to do and tells it how to do it. It takes whatever information it is given and performs the operations. It works sort of like the brain, the brain takes in input and based upon that input performs in some way producing an output. The function defintion is placed outside of main( ) and any other functions. A function is its own entity and should be thought of as such.
