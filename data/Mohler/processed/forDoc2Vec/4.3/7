4.3 Usually the same way you pass anything else... you do not have to specify the length of a char array, just pass it to the function by sending the name of the array. <br>Example:<br>char str[20];<br>isPalindrome(str); // this sends the char array to the function isPalindrome.<br><br>Otherwise, would need to send the length of the array as well.
