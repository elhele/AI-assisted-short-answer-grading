4.3 You pass the name of the array to the function.<br>So for:<br>int bin [10];<br>you pass it to an array like so:<br>jingle(bin);<br>but jingle must be declared correctly in order to receive an array, either with prototype<br>void jingle (int []);<br>or with the definition in its initialization:<br>void jingle (int array[]);<br><br>It's also worth noting that arrays are passed to function by reference, so as to not copy large arrays over and over and burn memory.  This gives the function complete control over the array however.
