12.5 Linked lists are very dynamic in that they can change and be added/subtracted to very easily because they are not linear in memory. Arrays are pre-specified in size to be cast over a certain amount of disk space.  This makes insertion into Arrays difficult because all elements must be shifted, and if you reach the end of the array, you are done even if you have more data to input.  Linked Lists do not run into these problems.
