12.9 if the node is a leaf it can simply be deallocated/deleted from memory, and its parent's reference to it changed to NULL. If the node has a single child, the pointer to it should be made to point to its child before deleting the node. Should the node have two children, the easiest solution may be to copy the node's entire subtree to a new array or tree, delete the node and all descendants, then add the elements taken from the subtree back into the main tree.
