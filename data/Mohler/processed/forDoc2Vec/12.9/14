12.9 In a binary search tree, you must first establish a proper replacement for the node you are about to delete, usually a child from the soon to be deleted node.  Once that replacement node has been found, you simply reassign it to where the node that is going to be deleted is.  After the deleted node has been usurped, you remove the deleted node from memory so it may be used again.
