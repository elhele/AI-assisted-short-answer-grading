8.6 i have an hard time explaining this so i'll show how infix is evaluated instead. Start with an infix expression, like, (((5+2)*5)+(400/(2+3))), and  push items until you get a ")" and once that happens, perform the operations until you reach an "("... with that complete, you will now have ((7*5)+(400/(2+3))) as now the expression that will be evaluated... perform last step again... (35+(400/(2+3))) is now the stack.... repeat agian... (35+(400/5)) is now the stack after that.... repeat... (35+80) is now the stack, repeat again... 115 is now the stack, and is returned.
